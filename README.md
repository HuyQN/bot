# Info

This is a bot I made for my friend and I to use. The main use of it is to scrape the website https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Main_Page for specific information my friends and I want. The information will then be sent to the chatting platform my friend group utilizes.

## Thing planned to be added or fixed

Note: Currently the website is not allowing scraping, so testing cannot be done

* Utilizing Robots.txt
* There was change to their html, so some errors have been occuring
* Better optimization with getRegion, and information storage in the database
* Craftable method is not working as intended
